# We only support AES128 and Elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) plus Diffie–Hellman (DH) in order to enable Forward
# Secrecy. This configuration ensures highest compatibility, best performance while still being extremely secure. Please
# note that using AES128 isn't really less secure than any other AES implementation.
