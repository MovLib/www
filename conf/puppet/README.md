# Puppet

I'm currently using [Geppetto](http://puppetlabs.github.io/geppetto/) to work with the various puppet files. NetBeans
doesn't have any support for puppet as of yet, hopefully this changes in the future. The file `.project` and the files
in the `.settings` directory are for Geppetto to handle the files correctly.
