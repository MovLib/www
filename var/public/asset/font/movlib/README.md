# The MovLib icon font

We generate our icon font with the IcoMoon App (Chrome Extension) by Keyamoon.
http://icomoon.io/

The session and thus all settings for the font can be loaded into the App with the movlib.json file.
The icon selection is also stored in the selection.json file and can therefore be imported separately.
This file contains all tags and configuration options needed for our font and is generated automatically by IcoMoon.
