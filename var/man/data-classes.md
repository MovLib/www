# Data Classes

**Data Classes** are objects that can interact with the software installed on the server. Each data class should
represent a single entity or a set of entities.

## Sets
A set is a data structure that provides zero, one, or more entities. The most important and basic rules for a set are as
follows:

1. The class name must end with **Set** (e.g. *MovieSet*)
2. The class must implement the set interface (`\MovLib\Data\SetInterface`)

Other than that no special rules apply
