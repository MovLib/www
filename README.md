Imagine [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/), [Discogs](http://www.discogs.com/), [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/), [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/), and [TheMovieDB](http://www.themoviedb.org/) combined in a totally free and open project.

[Sign up for the open beta](https://movlib.org/) or [visit the current development (alpha) version](https://alpha.movlib.org/).

Stay tuned!

## Local Development
> The Virtual Machine isn't finished yet, but it should be finished within the next days. The steps will stay the same.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/MovLib/www.git`
2. Install [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
3. Install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
4. Install [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
5. Depending on your operating system:
  * **Windows:** double click the `vagrantup.exe`
  * **Linux:** execute `vagrantup.sh`
  * **Mac:** no support (*yet*)

This will set up a full local development virtual machine that is similar to the real production server. The VM includes the [Debian 7 Wheezy](http://www.debian.org/) with [Gnome GUI](http://www.gnome.org/), the [Oracle NetBeans IDE](https://netbeans.org/), and all other dependencies provisioned via [Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/). You'll be able to develop, debug, and test right away.
